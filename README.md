<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]]

Steady was a web application designed and developed by BCIT first year students enrolled in the Digital Design & Development program. It was made to tackle the social issue of depression and its symptoms, such as lack of eating, sleep, and exercise.

The application asks the user questions based on their mood and returns an answer that best suits their mood. For example, in the case that a user has only eaten 1 meal by the end of the day, the application will recommend you to eat more, and vice-versa.

The application went through research, ideation, design, prototyping, development, and testing phases over the course of 10 weeks, learning every aspect of web application development. In the end, we created a product that tested our capabilities at that point in time with plenty of room for improvement.
